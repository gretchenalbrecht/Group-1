        <p style="background-color:rgb(242, 106, 206);">My name is Jochebed and I am a student at NJIT pursuing Architecture. I graduated from Essex Comunity college with an associate degree in Applied science.<br> I have always had a thing for builds, from the facade to the interior decorations. My love for building design made me decide to major in Architecture.<br> A Fun fact about me is I love art or creative things in general. I like to crochet sometimes.</p>
