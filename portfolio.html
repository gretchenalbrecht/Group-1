        <p style="color:firebrick">Ever since I was young, I've always been interested in anything creative. 
            <br>My dad is an architect and a very good artist, and he would show me how to paint, 
            how to use colored pencils, and how he designed buildings. In highschool I decided to take 
            a few art classes and fell in love with the creativity and freedom I had while in the class.
            It was then that I decided to go into a design major, as it is always something I've loved. </p>
